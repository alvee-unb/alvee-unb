### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ It's Alvee here!

I am a programmer and had been a researcher at the IBM/UNB Centre for Advanced Studies - Atlantic [CAS-Atlantic](https://github.com/CAS-Atlantic) during my master's in computer science at the University of New Brunswick. My research topic was SIMD support to Eclipse OpenJ9 for the AArch64 platform ([CAS Project ID - 1035](https://www-01.ibm.com/ibm/cas/canada/projects?projectId=1035)). Notable open-source projects that I contributed to include [Eclipse OMR](https://github.com/eclipse/omr) and [Eclipse OpenJ9](https://github.com/eclipse-openj9/openj9).

#### Interests : C++, Java, Microservices, Software Engineering
